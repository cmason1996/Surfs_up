## Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to examine weather data from weather stations scattered across the island of Oahu with the end goal of using the data to determine the location of Surf and Shake, an ice cream and surf shop. Specifically we will be looking at temperature observations for the months of June and December to determine if there are suitable temperatures to maintain a surf and ice cream shop year round.
